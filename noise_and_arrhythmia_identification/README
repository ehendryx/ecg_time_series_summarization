Directory Structure:
    Arrhythmia Detection Project (R Based):

    Noise Detection Project (Python Based):
        Datasets will include links to the sources we used for this project.
        Src contains all source code for VAE and classifier training / testing, as well as 
            a 'results' directory that would contain images and plots generated by the
            code. The weights for m106 exceed GitHub max file size, so they cannot be
            included in the repo.



Note: Paths listed in some of the files may need to be changed to reflect directory
    structure changes.
